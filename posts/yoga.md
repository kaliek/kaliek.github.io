Now I've been practising yoga for a little more than half an year, here're some reflections I have on this journey.

"Why yoga?", that's the question my yoga teacher asked us on the very first day of our 200 hr yoga teacher's training course. Well, I didn't think I'd really become a yoga teacher (unless I am really driven out of this software engineering industry at the age of 35). My goal was simply to know if I am doing it <em>correctly</em>. There are many things in life that we learn, but we may not understand how they really work. 

During the course, we touched a little about the philosophy and I was not very interested in this part. Easy asanas such as chaturanga are already difficult for me, and unlike my classmates most of whom have had years of experience, I was very new. But the good side is I do not have to "unlearn" anything; everything is new to me. So I was just focusing on how to do all the manageable poses properly.

Only after I joined the studio for regular practices, have I realised the yoga is more than pull up your knee cap and use your thigh muscles when you want to be stable in warrior three pose. Practising yoga is more like to find a focused state of mind while tackling the poses. It is also to let it go when you find some poses are difficult to you. To challenge yourself while remembering to be kind to yourself. After a while, as the strength and flexibility improves, you may be surprised what used to be unachievable becomes part of your routine practices. Good things will eventually come, all you need to do is to have a little faith and more patience.

One huge part of the yoga teacher's training course is to learn how to teach. Giving options to different levels of practitioners and having a good pace of a class are very important. When I go to different teacher's classes, I like to analyse their styles and their way of making students understand the poses. "Carry this state of mind even after you step off the mat", "Breathe in sun rises, breathe out sun sets", "Bend your knees towards your chest and give yourself a big hug" are just a few soothing and reassuring instructions off the top of my head. I often find myself softened after each practice, physically and mentally.

Be kind, and be strong.
